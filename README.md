# Bodyweight-Routine

Webserver, web interface, and tools for managing/tracking your body weight routine.

Inspired by https://github.com/mazurio/bodyweight-fitness-ios, which makes it easy to learn the [Reddit Recommended Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine), and to keep track of your progressions/reps/times quickly and easily.

Eventually I'm going to need more complex routines, and after searching around for alternatives (the above one has ceased development) and not finding anything I like, I decided to create a new one.

[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)
